# ZeroTrust Ledger

## 📌 Project Description
ZeroTrust Ledger is a minimal, trustless on-chain ledger allowing users to record tamper-proof entries without relying on intermediaries. Each entry is permanently stored on the blockchain and includes the creator's address, data, and timestamp.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a fully decentralized ledger system where transparency, immutability, and accessibility empower users to store important information in a trust-minimized way. ZeroTrust Ledger aims to set the foundation for secure and verifiable on-chain record keeping.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Immutable Ledger Entries**  
  Every entry added to the ledger is permanently stored and cannot be modified.

- **Ownership Tracking**  
  Each entry is tied to the creator’s address, enabling verifiable authorship.

- **On-Chain Transparency**  
  Anyone can read stored entries and validate their authenticity.

- **Lightweight & Gas-Efficient**  
  Optimized for simple data recording with minimal overhead.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)** for restricted-entry ledgers  
- **Encrypted Off-Chain Storage** with on-chain proofs  
- **Entry Tagging & Categorization** for organized lookups  
- **Event Indexing & Graph Tooling** for analytics dashboards  
- **Web3 UI Dashboard** for easier user interaction
